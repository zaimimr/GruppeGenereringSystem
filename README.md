# Group Generation System
## Working Title: Group Generation System
### Purpose of the Assignment
Create a system for automatically generating groups at various events (typically workshops, etc.).
Short description of the project proposal:
Forming groups in different contexts can take a surprising amount of time and can be difficult to achieve in a way that satisfies everyone. The goal is to develop a system that allows an organizer to create an event with participants and then send out an email to the participants containing a link to a web page (mobile support is required) along with a PIN code (this information should also be included as a QR code in the email). The participant then logs in via the link/QR code and registers whether they are present at the event.

Afterwards, the organizer should be able to automatically generate groups based on different criteria (e.g., maximum/minimum number of participants per group, participants can request to be in a group with specific other participants, etc.), and the system should then send an email to the participants about which group they have been assigned to. If it is not possible to create groups according to the specified criteria set by the organizer, the system should present a "best effort" suggestion.
